I have been a software developer pratically since I could reach a keyboard.

As I state in my profile, I really don't believe that a programmer, a developer, should
limit them to a single language. Because as long as you know **what** you want to do, 
the **how** is just a matter of research.

I've programmed in pretty much every single language in the past thirty years. However, 
one does have their strenghts, and mine are geared towards the Microsoft infrastructure.
Like VB, C#, SQL Server, among others.

Currently I'm self-employed, working from home.
